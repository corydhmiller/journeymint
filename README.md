# JourneyMint

A simple app meant to help you feel good about your accomplishments, especially the small ones.

### Current Bugs:
- iOS has some entry/tapping bugs.

### Notes:
- Recently realized the whole event.CurrentTarget parent thing. Wonder if I can set it up so instead of giving a data-id to every single possible element, I can just target the parent.

### Roadmap:
- Get notes working
- Selection of multiple items
- Revamped scoring
- Currency (what?)
- Archive so users can view what they've put in previous days
